# Weather-Application-

Weather Application project is created using HTML,CSS and Javascript .
In this Weather app, you enter the cityâ€™s name or country and it tells the weather of that area. We also add one more function that tells the weather of that area.
A weather app is an online web application tool that provides the user with current weather conditions along with temperature and other climatic conditions. We will use the API to fetch the weather data from the server and display it to the user.
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a technology that acts as an intermediary between the client and the server. APIs use a set of protocols through which users request data from the server through APIs, and the server redirects all the interrelational data to the user.
